# 05_interactive
Fifth assignment in the Draw with Code course.

This sketch is the evolution of the third assignment 03_texture to which I added interaction. 03_texture uses the random() function to assign color. Instead, in this assignment the color is detailed in an array[] and it is assigned to shapes by distance from mouseX and mouseY with the dist() function, scaled with the map() function to the array.length.
